    <h2>Descripton</h2>
    <p>Pasta is a type of food typically made from an unleavened dough of wheat flour mixed with water or eggs, and formed</p> into sheets or other shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking. Rice flour, or legumes such as beans or lentils, are sometimes used in place of wheat flour to yield a different taste and texture, or as a gluten-free alternative. <p>Pasta is a staple food of Italian cuisine.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 cup whole roasted almonds</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
      <li>1 cup grated pecorino Romano cheese, plus more to taste</li>
      <li>1 cup packed fresh basil leaves</li>
      <li>4 mint leaves (optional)</li>
      <li>1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>1 pound red cherry tomatoes or red grape tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 pound busiate pasta, or other curly shaped pasta, such as fusilli</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <p><li>Bring about 2 cups of water to a boil, remove from the heat, and stir in almonds; let sit for 3 to 4 minutes. Drain,<p>and once cool enough to handle, rub skins off with your hands; alternately; transfer drained almonds to a kitchen towel,</p> then fold up the towel and rub almonds until skins come off.</li></p>
      <p><li>Crush sliced garlic with kosher salt in a mortar and pestle into a smooth paste. Alternately, place garlic on a <p>board and sprinkle kosher salt on top; use the flat side of the knife to flatten, mash, and scrape the garlic and salt mixture until it is a smooth paste.</p></li></p>
      <p><li>Add peeled almonds to the jar of a blender, followed by the cheese, basil, mint, garlic paste, oil, and tomatoes. <p>Add the ingredients in this order, so that the almonds and cheese have a chance to grind before the wetter ingredients mix in.</p></li></p>
      <p><li>Begin to pulse blender on and off until almonds and cheese are ground, then continue to pulse until remaining<p>ingredients are incorporated. Blend on high until the pesto is as coarse or smooth as you like.</p></li></p>
      <p><li>Taste for salt, and adjust. Set aside while pasta is cooking.</li></p>
      <p><li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook busiate pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally,<p> until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Transfer pasta into a bowl with a strainer. Reserve starchy cooking liquid.</p></li></p>
      <p><li><p>Add about 1/3 cup of the pasta water into the bowl, and then transfer in the pesto, along with</p> a large pinch of salt, and toss to coat. More pasta water can be added to adjust the texture. <p>Once mixed, add another optional handful of cheese, and toss one last time. Serve immediately.</p></li></p>
